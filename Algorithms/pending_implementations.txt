Symbol tables
	Ordered implementaion
		[x]void put(Key key, Value val)
		[ ]Value get(Key key)
		[ ]void delete(Key key)
		[ ]put key-value pair into the table
		[ ](remove key from table if value is null )
		[ ]value paired with key
		[ ]( null if key is absent)
		[ ]remove key (and its value) from table
		[ ]boolean contains(Key key) is there a value paired with key ?
		[ ]boolean isEmpty() is the table empty?
		[ ]int size() number of key-value pairs
		[ ]Key min() smallest key
		[ ]Key max() largest key
		[ ]Key floor(Key key) largest key less than or equal to key
		[ ]Key ceiling(Key key) smallest key greater than or equal to key
		[ ]int rank(Key key) number of keys less than key
		[ ]Key select(int k) key of rank k
		[ ]void deleteMin() delete smallest key
		[ ]void deleteMax() delete largest key
		[ ]int size(Key lo, Key hi)
		[ ]number of keys in [lo..hi]
		[ ]Iterable<Key> keys(Key lo, Key hi) keys in [lo..hi] , in sorted order
		[ ]Iterable<Key> all keys in the table, in sorted order
