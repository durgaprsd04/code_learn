# Having a list of items to keep track of changes done

## Algorithms

> An academic approach to all algorithms small and large according to book by Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

## Design Patterns

> Creational, Behavioural and structural design patterns implementations.

## Hackerrank and LeetCode

> Solutioin to certain problems attempted.

## Practice

> Certain conceptual problems primarily with C# and Python

## System Design

> An attempt on system design both LLD and HLD

  

###Study plan

> Writing down a basic study plan to maneuver through the abundant study material.
